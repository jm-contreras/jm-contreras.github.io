Before my professional career, I was a doctoral student conducting neuroimaging experiments to understand how people think about social groups. I am formally trained as an experimental psychologist in social neuroscience, with an AB in psychology from Princeton University and an AM and a PhD in psychology from Harvard University.

In my spare time, I have written about data science and neuroscience. Now, I am writing about the process of programming a Monopoly simulator.
